## Prompt Adaptation Tips

### Making Prompts More Specific
Add details like:
- Specific brand colors
- Logo placements
- Custom iconography descriptions
- Text styling preferences

### Making Prompts More Abstract
Remove:
- Specific text labels (use placeholder descriptions)
- Brand elements
- Reduce node count for simplicity

### Adjusting Visual Intensity
- More dramatic: Add "cinematic lighting", "volumetric rays", "dramatic shadows"
- More subtle: Add "soft lighting", "muted colors", "minimalist"
- More tech: Add "holographic", "digital glitch effects", "matrix-style"
